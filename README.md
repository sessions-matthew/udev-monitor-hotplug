# Description

I was tired of having to configure manually the disposition of my monitors when I plugged them in.

So I decided to write this script that define custom behaviour when monitor are plugged in

You might want to adapt the script to your needs ./usr/local/bin/monitor-hotplug.sh

I was inspired by http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5469828/how-to-create-a-callback-for-monitor-plugged-on-an-intel-graphics

## Installation
  * clone the repo
  * sudo cp usr/local/bin/monitor-hotplug.sh /usr/local/bin/
  * sudo cp etc/udev/rules.d/99-monitor-hotplug.rules  /etc/udev/rules.d/
  * sudo service udev restart

## Debuging
  * sudo service udev stop
  * sudo udevd --debug 2>&1 | tee /tmp/udev.log
  * check what's happening when you plug/unplug your monitor
